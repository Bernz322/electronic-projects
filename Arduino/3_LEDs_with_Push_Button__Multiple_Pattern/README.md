## ‚ùì How to use

1. Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. Connect multiple LED's and a push button to the Arduino. Store them in a variable for easy access.
   <br>

   `const int redLED = 10;`
   <br>
   `const int yellowLED = 11;`
   <br>
   `const int greenLED = 12;`
   <br>
   `const int pinButton = 8;`

3. Initialize them in void setup().
   <br>

   `pinMode(greenLED, OUTPUT);`
   <br>
   `pinMode(yellowLED, OUTPUT);`
   <br>
   `pinMode(redLED, OUTPUT);`
   <br>
   `pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);`

4. Modify or Add Patterns to your liking.
   <br>
